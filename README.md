     The malicious use of artificial intelligence (AI) in crime is a growing concern. Currently, AI is exploited for various illicit activities, including cyber attacks, deepfake creation, and automated phishing. Future challenges may involve more sophisticated AI-driven attacks, necessitating advanced cybersecurity measures.
     The scope of AI-related crime could expand to include autonomous weapon systems, AI-driven financial fraud, and even manipulation of AI algorithms for illegal purposes. Addressing these challenges requires interdisciplinary collaboration between technologists, policymakers, and law enforcement to develop ethical frameworks, regulations, and countermeasures.

The ongoing development of AI and its integration into various domains underscores the need for proactive efforts to anticipate and mitigate potential risks associated with its malicious use. Public awareness, ethical guidelines, and international cooperation are crucial for managing the evolving landscape of AI-related crime.
       An Overview of Malicious Use and Abuse of AI Developed an AI-driven crime prediction system using Django,leveraging machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, SVM,Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree Classifier to analyze diverse dataset attributes. Integrated CountVectorizer for feature extraction,enhancing the system's ability to identify cyber threats like social 
engineering, misinformation, hacking, and autonomous weapon systems. Proficiently employed Pandas for data manipulation and Scikit-learn for model training, ensuring robustness in predicting crime 
types accurately.
